          <h2>DEFINED TERMS</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Defined Terms. References in this Will to the following capitalized terms have the meanings specified below in this Article:</p>
        <ol type="A">
          <li>
            <span class="subclause-header">Code</span>. References to the Code, various Sections of the Code, or to 26 U.S.C. followed by Section numbers, are to such designated Sections of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 as amended.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="subclause-header">Descendants</span>. Except as otherwise provided in this Will, references to Descendants shall mean the lineal blood descendants of any degree of the ancestor designated; provided, however, that such references shall include as then living Descendants, with respect to any provision of this Will, Descendants who have been conceived at any specific point in time relevant to such provision and who thereafter survive birth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="subclause-header">Executor</span>. Unless another meaning is clearly indicated or required by context or circumstances, the term Executor shall mean and include all persons or entities that may at any time be serving, including but not limited to the initial Executor or Executors (including all co-Executors), and any acting alternate or successor Executor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="subclause-header">Heirs</span>. References to Heirs are to those persons who would inherit separate personal property from the person designated under the statutes of descent and distribution of the State of <span id="testatorStateDisplay"></span>, if such person died intestate and unmarried at such time. A distribution to Heirs is a distribution in the shares and manner prescribed under such statutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="subclause-header">Per Stirpes</span>. When a distribution is to be made to a person's Descendants Per Stirpes property shall be divided into as many equal shares as there are (i) members of the nearest generation of Descendants who survive such person, and (ii) deceased members of that generation who left Descendants who survive such person. This division into shares shall begin at the generation nearest to such person that has a surviving member. Each surviving member of the nearest generation of Descendants with a member who survives such person shall receive one share, and the share that would have passed to each deceased member of that generation who left Descendants who survive such person shall be divided in a similar manner (by reapplying the preceding rule) among their Descendants who survive such person. For example, if a person has deceased children and surviving children when a distribution is to be made, the assets will be divided into equal shares at the child level and distributed Per Stirpes below that level; however, if the person has no surviving children at such time, that equal division will be made at the grandchild level (or lower, if appropriate) and distributed Per Stirpes below that level. This definition is intended to override any conflicting or contrary statutory or common law definition.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="subclause-header">Other Defined Terms</span>. Other terms may be defined throughout this Will for purposes of the provision in which they are included and those definitions apply to those terms in the context in which they are defined despite not being included in this Article.
